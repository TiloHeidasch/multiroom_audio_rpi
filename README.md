# multiroom_audio_rpi

This multiroom audio setup for the rasperry pi was initially inspired by Hydraplay: https://github.com/mariolukas/HydraPlay

It is using raspotify(https://github.com/dtcooper/raspotify) and snapcast(https://github.com/badaix/snapcast) to enable spotify multiroom audio.

Further more this was inspired by following threads: https://github.com/badaix/snapcast/issues/425 and https://github.com/dtcooper/raspotify/issues/30
